This website is intended to help share lived experiences of coeliac disease. It also wants to help make research data on coeliac disease more accessible.
 
I collect personal stories about coeliac disease at work and educational institutions. Here you will find written and other art testimonials. Via the research corner, you will also find interesting medical studies on the disease in a summarised format.
 
I hope developing this archive can help you gain further perspective and understanding of life with coeliac disease.
