The research corner intends to help share research-based information about Coeliac Disease in a summarised way. 
Here you will find information about Coeliac Disease, summaries of relevant studies and links to medical papers as well as support organisations that I collect for my academic work about Coeliac Disease.
By sharing a short summary and link each month, I want to improve the learning process about Coeliac Disease. I hope that this content will help individuals or parents to advocate better for themselves or their children when navigating life with Coeliac Disease. 
I recommend reading the original documents after engaging with my summaries. The research corner is for information purposes only. Please consult a medical professional about symptoms and medical questions.
