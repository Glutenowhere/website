Use of National UK Biobank data to compare individuals diagnosed with coeliac disease (n = 104; mean age, 63 years; 65% female) against a control group without coeliac disease (n = 198; mean age, 63 years; 67% female). Data analysis investigated the areas of cognitive deficits, mental health problems, and white matter disease in all these individuals.
<br><br>
**Results:**

In comparison to the healthy control group, individuals with celiac disease had

- significant deficits in reaction time (P = .004)
- significantly higher proportions had indications of anxiety (P = .025), depression (P = .015), thoughts of self-harm (P = .025) and health-related unhappiness (P = .010)
- significantly increased axial diffusivity in widespread locations of the brain

**Conclusion:**

Coeliac disease is associated with neurologic and psychological features and can impact cognitive skills, mental health and white matter in the deeper tissues of the brain.
