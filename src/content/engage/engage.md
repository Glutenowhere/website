**How does it work?**

My research is based on interactive and participatory data collection processes. You can choose how to get involved. Do you have time to share your life story in an (anonymous) interview? Do you like to write about yourself, an experience or a helpful tip in a blog post? Is there a photo that you took that shows your life with Coeliac Disease? My website collects and shares all these experiences to help us and others learn more about Coeliac Disease.
With your consent, I also transform your spoken words, photos and written stories into academic and evidence-based publications.
For information about my current research study which is funded by the University of Essex, please have a look at the following project overview and research ethic guidance.
