            When I got diagnosed with Coeliac Disease at the beginning of my
            University studies, I felt relieved knowing that my suffering had a
            name, and that there were more people like me out in the world. The
            feeling of relief changed once I learnt that my symptoms had changed
            little, that a restrictive diet as a young woman at University was a
            dealbreaker in friendships and relationships, and that the disease
            was misunderstood in society. I decided to focus on my studies,
            earning a Bachelor and Master degree. I did not know how to work
            full-time with a body that showed persistent and life- affecting
            symptoms, and colleagues who quizzed me about it. For several years,
            I worked in Finance related roles at two Russell Group Universities-
            always close to giving in. What kept me going? The belief that I
            wasnâ€™t trying hard enough! Finding the chronic illness community
            online made me realise that the problem was not me but that our
            workplaces do not treat employees as human beings. I thought about
            all the experiences I make daily with Coeliac Disease. I started
            wondering how other employees with Coeliac Disease feel. Over the
            time, I got more confident about demanding that our workplaces
            should listen to our experiences. What if it is time to build a
            platform to hear these stories? I enrolled for a PhD at the
            University of Essex to research these experiences: What is YOUR
            worklife living with Coeliac Disease like?
