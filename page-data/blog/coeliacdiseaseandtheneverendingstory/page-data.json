After putting a lot of pressure on myself for years, I learnt that it is okay to struggle in these situations. The new perspective helped me to find a way to enjoy these moments again.</p>\n<p>When I was first diagnosed with Coeliac Disease at the age of 21, I did not realise how many social gatherings involve food and how isolating it can be to follow a strict gluten-free diet. I turned to online resources that made it sound simple to be around people and food. Those websites left me irritated and confused as I did not feel comfortable in those situations and I questioned whether I was making it too complicated for myself. Having lived with Coeliac Disease for several years now, I found my way of dealing with social gatherings. Here are 5 tips I am trying to follow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Focus on a positive reason for showing up. If there is a family or work-related event and it is obvious that the store-bought cake or prepared barbeque will not be gluten-free, there will be another positive reason for going such as spending time with a cousin who is not around often.</li>\n<li>Teach yourself to say ‘no’. It is easier said than done to decline food or drink offers particularly if it is in a family or work environment. I don’t drink alcohol and eat very healthily because of my Coeliac Disease. People often roll their eyes when I refuse food, but I tell myself that I do not owe them an explanation. This is also true when declining an invitation or leaving early. If there is no good reason for showing up and it is not a mandatory event, it is okay to say no to the host.</li>\n<li>I think learning to say ‘no’ is deeply connected to this piece of advice: be confident! When people realise that the person in front of them comes across as knowledgeable, they ask fewer questions and are more likely to accept the received response. Living a strictly gluten-free life is not a choice, but a medical necessity and it is okay to tell them.</li>\n<li>Bring your own food. It took me some time to think positively about meal planning and preparation. My skills have improved so much that I get compliments for the food I bring sometimes. If you are fortunate enough to have a body that digests fish and chips or gluten-free burgers, I would suggest stopping at your trusted pub or restaurant and bringing it along.</li>\n<li>Try to be the organiser of the event to be able to choose the restaurant, coffee shop or host everyone at your place. I still struggle with this piece of advice myself and therefore, I put this at the bottom of my list. I think it comes down to confidence and the group of people. Friends and close relatives will be more likely to agree to a venue switch than co-workers. But some events just can’t be moved to a different place. In those cases, I bring my food, eat in advance or I leave early to eat at home.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you feel like me and the general advice out there is not that helpful, I hope my story will show that it is okay to struggle with social gatherings.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Coeliac Disease and the never-ending story of navigating social gatherings ","date":"Thursday, 25 August 2022","author":"Anne Steinhoff","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#382818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/81fed0a51a803045f93f3c321b8dc460/68a6f/coeliac%20disease%20and%20the%20neverending%20story.jpg","srcSet":"/static/81fed0a51a803045f93f3c321b8dc460/dfcd4/coeliac%20disease%20and%20the%20neverending%20story.jpg 1008w,\n/static/81fed0a51a803045f93f3c321b8dc460/b97c6/coeliac%20disease%20and%20the%20neverending%20story.jpg 2016w,\n/static/81fed0a51a803045f93f3c321b8dc460/68a6f/coeliac%20disease%20and%20the%20neverending%20story.jpg 4032w","sizes":"(min-width: 4032px) 4032px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/81fed0a51a803045f93f3c321b8dc460/80cfb/coeliac%20disease%20and%20the%20neverending%20story.webp 1008w,\n/static/81fed0a51a803045f93f3c321b8dc460/66d80/coeliac%20disease%20and%20the%20neverending%20story.webp 2016w,\n/static/81fed0a51a803045f93f3c321b8dc460/5cc0d/coeliac%20disease%20and%20the%20neverending%20story.webp 4032w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 4032px) 4032px, 100vw"}]},"width":4032,"height":3024}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/coeliacdiseaseandtheneverendingstory"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1605325511"],"slicesMap":{}}
