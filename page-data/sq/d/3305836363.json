{"data":{"bio":{"html":"<p>I got diagnosed with Coeliac Disease at the beginning of my University studies. I remember how relieved I felt knowing that my suffering had a name. But the feeling of relief changed quickly: many of my symptoms remained, the restrictive diet as a young woman at University turned into a dealbreaker in friendships and relationships, and often I felt misunderstood by my family, friends and doctors.</p>\n<p>I decided to focus on my studies, earning a Bachelor's and Master's degree. I did not know how to work full-time with a body that showed persistent and life-affecting symptoms, and colleagues who quizzed me about it. For several years, I worked in Finance and Accounting related roles at two Russell Group Universities- always close to giving in. What kept me going? The belief that I wasnâ€™t trying hard enough!</p>\n<p>Finding the chronic illness community online made me realise that the problem was not me. But our workplaces. I started wondering how other employees with Coeliac Disease feel. What if it is time to build a platform to hear these stories? I enrolled for a PhD at the University of Essex to research these experiences: What is YOUR work life living with Coeliac Disease like?</p>\n<p>Nowadays, I am a Lecturer at the University of Essex. I teach students critical perspectives on accounting practices. I found my place in this world. But I remain passionate about the need to speak up about Coeliac Disease.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","cardTitle":"Anne Steinhoff","cardSubtitle":"Lecturer at University of Essex","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8c8b8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/047c7da549a753ea22688e6caa53a234/47930/anne.jpg","srcSet":"/static/047c7da549a753ea22688e6caa53a234/e07e1/anne.jpg 100w,\n/static/047c7da549a753ea22688e6caa53a234/dd515/anne.jpg 200w,\n/static/047c7da549a753ea22688e6caa53a234/47930/anne.jpg 400w,\n/static/047c7da549a753ea22688e6caa53a234/baaed/anne.jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/047c7da549a753ea22688e6caa53a234/d8057/anne.webp 100w,\n/static/047c7da549a753ea22688e6caa53a234/2e34e/anne.webp 200w,\n/static/047c7da549a753ea22688e6caa53a234/416c3/anne.webp 400w,\n/static/047c7da549a753ea22688e6caa53a234/c1587/anne.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":400}}}}},"socialMedia":{"nodes":[{"id":"2ceabd59-2292-5214-a2bb-f566dddb3e44","frontmatter":{"name":"Instagram","link":"https://www.instagram.com/glutenout23/","iconName":"fa-instagram"}},{"id":"87d319ef-f4f5-5f9a-86a7-de4d98ec786b","frontmatter":{"name":"LinkedIn","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anne-steinhoff-04689661/","iconName":"fa-linkedin"}},{"id":"f97ad586-6ef8-5002-99e3-0a3c23bea309","frontmatter":{"name":"Twitter","link":"https://twitter.com/ane_ste","iconName":"fa-twitter"}}]}}}
