{"data":{"bio":{"html":"<p>When I got diagnosed with Coeliac Disease at the beginning of my University studies, I felt relieved knowing that my suffering had a name, and that there were more people like me out in the world. The feeling of relief changed once I learnt that my symptoms had changed little, that a restrictive diet as a young woman at University was a dealbreaker in friendships and relationships, and that the disease was misunderstood in society.</p>\n<p>I decided to focus on my studies, earning a Bachelor and Master degree. I did not know how to work full-time with a body that showed persistent and life- affecting symptoms, and colleagues who quizzed me about it. For several years, I worked in Finance related roles at two Russell Group Universities- always close to giving in. What kept me going? The belief that I wasnâ€™t trying hard enough!</p>\n<p>Finding the chronic illness community online made me realise that the problem was not me but that our workplaces do not treat employees as human beings. I thought about all the experiences I make daily with Coeliac Disease. I started wondering how other employees with Coeliac Disease feel.</p>\n<p>Over the time, I got more confident about demanding that our workplaces should listen to our experiences. What if it is time to build a platform to hear these stories? I enrolled for a PhD at the University of Essex to research these experiences: What is YOUR worklife living with Coeliac Disease like?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/53e1b9d56dcc71a0b8d2c22deaeae2ed/90ed1/anne.jpg","srcSet":"/static/53e1b9d56dcc71a0b8d2c22deaeae2ed/875ed/anne.jpg 50w,\n/static/53e1b9d56dcc71a0b8d2c22deaeae2ed/98cbe/anne.jpg 100w,\n/static/53e1b9d56dcc71a0b8d2c22deaeae2ed/90ed1/anne.jpg 200w,\n/static/53e1b9d56dcc71a0b8d2c22deaeae2ed/2070e/anne.jpg 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/53e1b9d56dcc71a0b8d2c22deaeae2ed/1a81d/anne.webp 50w,\n/static/53e1b9d56dcc71a0b8d2c22deaeae2ed/f6ea0/anne.webp 100w,\n/static/53e1b9d56dcc71a0b8d2c22deaeae2ed/b5535/anne.webp 200w,\n/static/53e1b9d56dcc71a0b8d2c22deaeae2ed/f5c71/anne.webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":150}}}}},"project":{"html":"<p>Consectetur ullamco eiusmod reprehenderit sint aliquip anim culpa veniam minim eu ut laboris ut.
